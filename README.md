# XKCD
Originally started as a BYU CS260/CS201R project.

It works, all bugs that have been found have been resolved.

It requires both a separate web server, such as apache, to deliver the page and it must have the node.js proxy as a proxy server on the web server that delivered the original page.

A working example is found at https://bryceml.us/xkcd/

Version 1.1 adds a link to get to the original xkcd page if desired.

Version 1.2 takes into account that the api now sends https urls for the image.
